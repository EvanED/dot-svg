- Edges "reset" their color to red on mouse out even if that's not what color
  they were originally. (WFAs use red transitions so that was a stopgap for a
  bit. I've got a fix for this, just not integrated yet.)

- Quotes around the 'onhover' attribute hang around in the output.

- Fill in empty nodes with white so that there's more hit area.

- Doesn't work with all browsers. Works for me with Firefox and Opera, but
  not Chrome or IE.
