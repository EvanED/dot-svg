- Quotes around the 'onhover' attribute hang around in the output.

- Fill in empty nodes with white so that there's more hit area.

- Doesn't work with all browsers. Works for me with Firefox and Opera, but
  not Chrome or IE.

- Probably won't work (or as well) if there are things other than ellipses as
  node shapes.
